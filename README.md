# NoSQL-API-JRMH18

## Description
Using MongoDB for database, I built a web application with API for a social network where users can create a friend list, react to friends’ thoughts, and share their thoughts. I used Express.js for routing, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition, I used the Express.js and Mongoose packages. I created my own data using Insomnia after I’ve created my API. Because this application won’t be deployed, I created a walkthrough video that demonstrates it's functionality and all of the following acceptance criteria being met. 

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a user’s friend list
```
